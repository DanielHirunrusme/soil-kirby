# The London College of Fashion at the University of the Arts London reimagines spaces in which learning takes place by establishing new links among disciplines and overlapping shared programs. 

The building brings together six previously separate departments into one site to create a porous condition that explores collaborative educational models. Amongst profound transformations in the sharing of information, the university as a physical space is a significant social condenser and symbolic space of collaboration.

The vertical campus achieves porosity with subject-clusters, which eschew traditional department divisions. A network of atria are the permeable border between subject-clusters, providing circulation via spiral staircases and informal gathering spaces. Their strategic location heightens the awareness of various activities within the building. These aspects, in tandem with the collective quality of these spaces—workshops, studios and exhibitions—make the atria the social nodes of the campus.
