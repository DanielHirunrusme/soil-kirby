Text: 

# New Museum commissioned SO – IL to provide workplace consult and design services for New Inc., the first museum-led incubator. New Inc. is a shared workspace and professional development program designed to support creative practitioners working in the areas of art, technology, and design.

Launched in summer 2014, New Inc. provides a collaborative space for a highly selective, interdisciplinary community of one hundred members to investigate new ideas and develop a sustainable practice. With 11,000 square feet of dedicated workspace, labs, social areas, and event space, New Inc. offers an ideal environment for seeding and testing creative enterprises.

By offering a variety of work settings (different in style, tone, and atmosphere) and strategically locating communal programs such as the kitchen, lockers, and lounge, SO – IL maximized the space and set the stage for chance encounters, interaction, and cross pollination in line with New Inc.’s mission. A high level of transparency pulls daylight deep into the building, offering comfort and creating an awareness of place to support productivity and worker well-being.
