# The Wynwood Gateway Park is situatedÂ in the heart of the burgeoning Wynwood Arts District in Miami, Florida. Wynwood is a place that has been made famous in recent years by its incredible and omnipresent street art murals, art galleries, boutique independent retailers, celebrity sightings, and Art Basel.

The idea for the space is to bring the community together, as well as attract visitors and tourists. The park aims to cater to many different types of people. In the day time, families can meet here for gatherings, picnics, or simply find a quiet place to do yoga or read. In the evening it is able to cater to concerts, weddings, parties, and receptions.

Through the use of semi-transparent, intersecting, and stacking walls we are able to diversify and activate an urban gathering space. Working synergistically with the fabric barriers, varying textures of softscape generate a plethora of sensorial experiences that propose a new relationship between the natural and artificial.

In an open design competition, this project was awarded third prize.
