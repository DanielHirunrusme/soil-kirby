Intro:

Text: 

# This expansion of an important historical Kentucky home responds to the beautiful natural setting in which the house is located. Instead of a typical transparent garden room, we propose a fa√ßade that reflects and filters the surroundings to create an enveloping magical atmosphere.

The kitchen counter, cooking island and floor are all created from poured-in-place concrete. Material innovation was also used for the roof. It is made of fiber reinforced plastic, eliminating the need for structure.
