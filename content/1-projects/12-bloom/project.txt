# This is the design for a temporary pavilion for M+, a museum of contemporary art in west Kowloon, Hong Kong. The design, blooM+ , consists of three elements: the platform, the cable dome, and the gallery volume. 

The platform holds an exhibition floor, support spaces, and a flexible outside area. Over this landscape rises a dense constellation of poles and cables that seemingly float in the air. This structure holds shade screens and windscreens to become a place marker and anteroom of the gallery volume. The structural principle applied is tensegrity (tensional-integrity). This visionary construct relies on the synergy of various individual parts to create an integrated whole. Generally heavy and opaque, this art space is open and lightâ€”defying gravity and creating vistas to the park and the city beyond. Support spaces are placed at the sides, leaving the middle of the space empty. This column-free space easily transforms from a gallery layout to a lecture hall, or space for dance and film. It has mediated skylights above as well as full blackout capabilities. At night, dynamically programmed LED lights at the connections create a starry firmament in flux. The organization of platform, dome, and gallery volume creates a dynamic set of relationships between inside and out, enticing people to enter and explore. blooM+ creates a holistic ecology in which all elements are in concert with each other, materially, spatially, and socially. The whole is larger than the sum of its parts.
