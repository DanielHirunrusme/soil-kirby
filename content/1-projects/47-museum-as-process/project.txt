# Displayed in conjunction with the grand opening of the Jan and Maria Manetti Shrem Museum of Art, “SO – IL: Museum as Process” consists of artifacts that illustrate and interpret the process of creating the museum itself. Created in collaboration with artists and designers, the exhibition comprises two works with Studio TheGreenEyl and a series of three photographs by Luisa Lambri.

Studio TheGreenEyl and SO – IL’s Connective Field is an exploration of the Manetti Shrem Museum’s canopy as a social catalyst. The model is composed of a porous aluminum plate that hovers above a field of distorted icons depicting Davis’ campus life. The images are animated by the movement and perspective of the viewer looking through its louvers.

The Zone is a light installation featuring a quote from Tarkovsky's Stalker, displayed on the gallery wall. Three flashlights turn on, one after another. With each exposure a different section of the text fades in and out of view.

Luisa Lambri photographed the Manetti Shrem Museum during the summer of 2016. Her photographic work over the last two decades has focused on the interplay between architecture, light and space, either by deconstructing and abstracting modernist architecture or by investigating the work of other artists equally interested in the relationship between sculpture, light and space. Lambri’s delicately crafted photographs oscillate between objective representations of architecture and other sculptural forms and her reactions to and perceptions of the spaces she photographs in highly abstract fashion.

“SO – IL: Museum as Process” invites its viewers to experience museum architecture in a new way. One that is “neither isolated nor exclusive, but open and permeable; not a static shrine, but a constantly evolving public event,” in the words of Florian Idenburg, founding partner of SO – IL.
