Text: 

# In 2014, Knoll Furniture Company approached SO – IL to investigate contemporary work spaces through the design of a new furniture line. 1 Simultaneously, a research studio was initiated by the two at Harvard Graduate School of Design, which informs the direction of the project.

Modes of work have become more fluid, casual, spontaneous. The contemporary office requires flexibility and its furniture must accept misuse and reinterpretation.

For Knoll, SO – IL has produced three pieces; they are simultaneously seating, surfaces, and objects made to respond to the increasingly fluid nature of creative production in the work space. The pieces act as an assembly; they absorb new organizations and allow for serendipitous interaction. The new office space is unscripted. This assembly of furniture for Knoll is not a defined set for production, but instead, a provocation for new ideas.
