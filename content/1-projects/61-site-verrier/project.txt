# Hidden in the bucolic landscape of Northern Vosges Natural Park, Site Verrier de Meisenthal is an active cultural center in a historic glass factory dating back to the 18th century. SO – IL’s intervention defines a contemporary institutional identity in dialogue with an industrial heritage.

Site Verrier is a publicly funded project composed of three independent yet interrelated institutions: the glass museum (Musée du Verre et du cristal) – a living memory tracing the history of glass at the site; the CIAV (Centre International d’Art Verrier) – an international glass art center where traditional craftsmanship meets contemporary practices; and the Cadhame (Halle verrière) – a multidisciplinary cultural space hosting art installations, happenings and concerts.

The design of Site Verrier alludes to glass production with an undulating poured-in-place concrete surface. The surface functions as roof, ceiling and wall, connecting the site’s buildings and framing a public plaza. New functions are sensitively introduced under and over this surface, including offices, workshop areas, a cafe and restaurant, and a 500-seat blackbox theater that can be reconfigured as a theater with standing room for 700 or opened into a concert hall for 3,000. The new public space heightens civic awareness of the historical site and also introduces a highly flexible space to host outdoor theater, concerts, and seasonal festivities.
