# Collecting art entails a constant series of choices, where successive decisions lead to new connections and insights. How do you create relationships in a constantly expanding universe?

In organizing the exhibition Bad Thoughts, the Collection of Martijn en Jeanette Sanders, we have tried to represent theÂ experience of collection spatially. The various rooms are organized in such fashion that each visitor must decide its own route. By leaving the connections open, the visitor becomes the author of his or her own path, thus creating personal connections and insights.
