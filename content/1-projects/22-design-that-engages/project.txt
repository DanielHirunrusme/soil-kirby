WE BELIEVE ARCHITECTURE CAN NURTURE NEW FORMS OF INTERACTION AND AWARENESS OF OUR SURROUNDINGS. Engaging with communities and working across disciplines, we develop novel approaches to nature, heritage and housing in evolving and historic settings.

In reaction to shortages of affordable housing in growing megacities around the world, tiNY proposes a new type for New York—micro-units. This sustainable model incorporates community workspace and a shared green roof. Southern exposure and cross-ventilation help the building to reach LEED Platinum.

Opening green areas along buildings rather than repeating the default backyard, we suggested a new porous housing type for Athens in the project Party Wall. Extending this model can gradually transform closed-off city blocks through a network of light-filled community space.

Responding to Seoul's historic urban fabric, we draped Kukje Gallery in a chainmail veil that echoes the surrounding rooflines. The modest footprint leaves space for a public plaza with materials and detailing that refer to regional techniques.

A soft form in concrete diffuses the exterior presence of Brooklyn art space Amant. Curved, textured surfaces balance the abstract interiors with the area's regular geometries and industrial history.

In a Syracuse neighborhood dominated by public housing towers, we recommended a rotated courtyard typology to form shared spaces of varied scales. The proposal combines low-income and reentry housing, offering a new landmark for community.

We introduced a multilevel housing typology into a largely single-story area of León, Mexico, to work toward reinvigorating the city center. Shared spaces throughout the building encourage communal events, and retail space below supports economic development.
