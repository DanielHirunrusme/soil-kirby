Text: 

adAPT NYC is a pilot program that was launched in July 2012 to develop a new model of housing—micro-units. tiNY is the first sustainable economic model for affordability as it does not rely on HPD Subsidy. SO – IL’s proposal for tiNY Housing at East 27th Street in Manhattan delivers identical 236 square foot homes in a single-loaded corridor tower. The approach affords a unique building identity and an opportunity to make small homes desirable. 

tiNY Housing proposes limiting the developer return and redirecting free market demand to subsidize increasingly affordable homes. Ground floor bike parking, community room, convenience kiosk, and full time super with cellar level storage lockers, laundry and short term office space support 96 homes on floors 2–17 with accessible green roof above.

Ample southern exposure and cross ventilated homes in a highly sealed and insulated tower establish a building that will be LEED Platinum, achieve over 90 Green Community Points and exceed Passive House Standards when measured per occupant.
