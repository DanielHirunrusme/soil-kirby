We design to engage our evolving world. Our process melds digital technology with traditional craft, moving off the screen into physical space. The result is participatory: we create open platforms of exchange that welcome transformation and reinterpretation, working with clients and collaborators to realize the unique vision of each project. We believe that architecture has the power to offer a sense of wonder and place.

We have been recognized with awards for both architecture and design. These include an AIA San Francisco Merit Award, the Curbed Groundbreakers Award, the Progressive Architecture Award, the Architectural League Emerging Voices Award, and the MoMA PS1 Young Architects Program Award. We are included in the permanent collections of institutions like MoMA and Chicago Art Institute.

Our work is frequently featured in publications like The New York Times, WSJ, Wired, BOMB, Domus, and Architectural Record. According to the Los Angeles Times, our design for the Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at the University of California, Davis, suggests “fresh directions for American architecture.”

SO–IL was founded by Florian Idenburg and Jing Liu in 2008 and has been led with partner Ilias Papageorgiou since 2013.
