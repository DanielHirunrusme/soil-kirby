The New Museum has commissioned SO–IL to design their new incubator for art, technology, and design. Slated to open in summer 2014 in the Museum’s adjacent building at 231 Bowery, this new not-for-profit initiative aims to create a hybrid educational and professional workspace—a dynamic 24/7 center where more than sixty start-up and creative entrepreneurs will gather. SO–IL’s proposal will address the notion that there are different modes of working, from concentrated work alone or in small groups, to having meetings with external consultants, or Skype calls. The renovation will involve a set of elements that can be adjusted to suit a constantly evolving program.
