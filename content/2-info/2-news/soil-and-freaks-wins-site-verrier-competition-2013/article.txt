Text: SO–IL, in collaboration with FREAKS freearchitects, wins first prize in a competition to re-envision the historical Site Verrier de Meisenthal. Comprised of a cluster of buildings, the former glass factory will be unified by a concrete “tapestry.” This “tapestry” simultaneously clarifies the site’s complex topography and creates a highly flexible space that allows for a variety of functions from festivals to outdoor performances.
