The newest iteration of Blueprint is now open at Storefront for Art and Architecture through March 21, 2015. Curated by Florian Idenburg and Jing Liu of SO–IL, and artist Sebastiaan Bremer, the exhibition invited artists and architects to reflect on the theme of origination through the medium of the blueprint.

Realized as part of the exhibition, an installation by SO–IL shrink-wraps the gallery’s façade of varied and irregular openings, transforming it’s exterior into one continuous and undulating surface. The resulting interior provides an intimate space that allows the viewer to see behind the mind of the artist.
