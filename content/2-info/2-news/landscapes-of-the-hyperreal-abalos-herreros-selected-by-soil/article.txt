In conjunction with Out of the Box: Ábalos & Herreros, the exhibition Landscapes of the Hyperreal: Ábalos & Herreros selected by SO–IL results from guest curators Florian Idenburg and Jing Liu’s focused immersion in the Ábalos & Herreros fonds at the CCA. 

Accompanying the exhibition is an installation; a pixelated carpet which spans the entire exhibition floor. The exhibition runs from July 23rd, 2015 to September 13th, 2015.
