Text: Conceptions of Space, on view between July 4–October 19, 2014, addresses how contemporary architects continue to embrace spatial creation as a fundamental focus of their work. Participants offer a global panorama of architectural practice today, from acclaimed architects such as Herzog & de Meuron, Álvaro Siza, and Kengo Kuma, to young, emergent practices such as Pezo von Ellrichshausen, Chile; Ryue Nishizawa, Japan; Ensamble Studio, Spain; and the New York-based SO–IL and MOS Architects.
