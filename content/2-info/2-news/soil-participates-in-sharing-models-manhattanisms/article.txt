Text: “Sharing Models: Manhattanisms” explores the emergence of a culture that is marked by a return to, redefinition, and expansion of the notion of the commons. For the exhibition, Manhattan has been divided into 30 section cuts across New York City from the East River to the Hudson River. SO–IL’s contribution, “Noah’s Ark”, imagines Manhattan’s great grid undone by the endlessly shrinking atomic unit and the chaotic energy embedded between floating particles. All 30 models will be presented as an exquisite corpse at Storefront for Art and Architecture from July 15th – September 2nd, 2016.
