Text: SO–IL is excited to collaborate with Ana Prvački for the upcoming 2017 Chicago Architecture Biennial! This year’s Biennial, titled “Make New History,” will take a decidedly historical look at architecture. The show hopes to address the persistent “insistence on creating works that are unprecedented and unrelated to architectures of the past.”  The second Biennial will run from September 16th, 2017 through January 8th, 2018.
