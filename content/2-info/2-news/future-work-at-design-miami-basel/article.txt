Text: For Knoll Furniture Company, SO–IL has produced three furniture pieces; simultaneously seating, surfaces, and objects made to respond to the increasingly fluid nature of creative production in the workspace. The collection will be on display as part of Design Miami’s Design Curio program in Basel from June 14—June 19, 2016.
